## Motivation
Kind of childish but it looks nice having these badges placed in websites.
By retaining these badges in a github repository I can easily include them
into my README.md files.

## Links/URLs/Credits

## Version
The option to create releases on GitHub is pretty nice. I really do like it
since it give me easy access to all the files without git cloning the complete
repository.
